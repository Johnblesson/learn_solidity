- Solidity is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript.
- Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features.
- With Solidity, you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.
- When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity.
