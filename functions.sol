// Functions
// Functions are the building blocks of smart contracts
// Functions are used to create the logic of the smart contract
// A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task
// Functions are used to create the logic of the smart contract
// A function is basically a group of code that can be reused anywhere in the smart contract, or in other smart contracts.

// In Solidity, functions are blocks of code that can be defined within a 
// smart contract and are used to perform specific tasks or operations. 
// They are fundamental building blocks of smart contracts and enable 
// the execution of specific actions when called. Functions can be used.

// Functions are the building blocks of smart contracts
// Functions are used to create the logic of the smart contract.

// Function Types
// There are two types of functions in Solidity:
// --- Declared functions
// --- Undeclared functions

// Declared functions
// Declared functions are functions that are declared within the smart contract.

// Declaring a function
// Modifying state variables
// Emitting events
// Creating new contracts
// Calling other functions
// Sending Ether (or tokens) via calls
// Returning data from the function
// Declaring a function
// Marking a function as pure or view
// Assembly certain opcodes
// Using low-level calls

// Undeclared functions
// Undeclared functions are functions that are not declared within the smart contract.
